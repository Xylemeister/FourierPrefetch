# FYP Prefetcher Logbook 

## Daily Logs:

### 19/02/2026

* I am currently working to implement a new  prefetcher on the champsim simulator. Right now im running the simulator with no prefetcher to check what output does it produce and how long it takes to run.
* I am also connecting to the schools HPC environment because my laptop takes a while to run the simulator.

#### Example of what Champsim produces: 

* Example of statistics produced by champsim is given in [output.txt](output.txt)

#### cluster Access Setup: 
1. First and foremost I need to enable IPV6 on my WSL instance.
2. To ssh i just need to execute the following: ssh username@cluster_name and then give my password.
3. unfortunately I am unable to connect it when working from WSL2, and I need to use powershell but I dont think that is a problem. 
4. I've also requested for access to the unified accesss so I can acess the HPC off-campus.
